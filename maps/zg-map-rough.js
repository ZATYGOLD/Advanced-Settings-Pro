// Applies the Map Age setup setting when a map script raises its rough ground.
//
// A New world is freshly buckled and still broken: more rough ground, less flat.
// An Old world has been worn down: less rough ground, broader plains. Standard
// leaves the base game's own terrain alone.
//
// Rough is TERRAIN_HILL in the game's data, which is why the base symbols and
// the hill score below keep that name; everything the player reads says rough.
//
// Map Age moves rough ground only. Mountains are the Mountains setting's
// business, so the two never pull on the same tiles: pick a map age for how
// broken the ground is, and Mountains for how many peaks rise out of it.
